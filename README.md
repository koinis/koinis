### Hello people! 👋

I am mrpol!👦
I am 20 years old, I am university student and I am currently studying CSE (Computer Science & Engineering).💻 

I like technology, programming languages and cybersecurity. I am really interested in anything related to cybersecurity, so I try to practise properly and enhance my knowledge in this field day by day. In my GitHub profile you are able to find some personal projects (either about cybersecurity or not).

My future goal is to become a professional in the field of cybersecurity and use my skills for a good purpose.💪

Please, feel free to contact me!🤳💼
