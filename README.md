### Hello people! ðŸ‘‹

I would like to introduce myself with a nickname, I am mrpol!ðŸ‘¦
I am 20 years old, I am university student and I am currently studying CSE (Computer Science & Engineering).ðŸ’» 

I like programming languages and cybersecurity. In my GitHub profile you are able to find some personal projects in Python and Java. I started to discover the world of cybersecurity before a few months and I have to say that I am really interested in anything related to this field.

My future goal is to become a professional in the field of cybersecurity and use my skills for a good purpose.ðŸ’ª

So, I try getting better day by day...
